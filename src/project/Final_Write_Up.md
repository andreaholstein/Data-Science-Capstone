#Project Overview (Table of Contents)

Requirements: (All)
- This project uses the following Python libraries
- (Adi's Comments)Tech stack: List the tools, languages, and frameworks (Python, Jupyter, mapping libraries, dashboard platform) along with what you’ll deliver (heatmaps, interactive map, slide deck) and a roadmap of the 5 day sprint.


NumPy : For fast matrix operations.
pandas : For analysing and getting insights from datasets.
matplotlib : For creating graphs and plots
seaborn : 

Methodology (All) 
- (Adi's Comments) Methodology: Outline the specific steps you’ll take—e.g. geocoding customer addresses, calculating catchment areas, scoring locations by foot traffic or demographic fit—and any algorithms or other libraries/datasets you will use.


Review of Raw Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (Joanne)
- Understanding the Raw Data
    - List features and data types
- Understanding the Features
- Correlation between features 

Conclusion of reviewing the raw data and EDA (Joanne)
- How many states are there?
- How many of each gender?
- What categories are there?
- What season has the most spending?
- How many customers have subscriptions?
- What items are sold?

Assumptions, Limiting Conditions, Data Risks (Joanna)
(Adi's Comments) Data risks & assumptions: You note bias and initial assumptions—consider specifying how you’ll test for sampling bias (e.g., comparing dataset demographics to census data) and how you’ll handle missing or sparse location data.

Data Cleaning (Andrea and Joanne )
- Column titles 
- Check for nulls 
- Check data types 
- Class imbalance (Joanne)

Data Cleaning Conclusions (Andrea and Joanne)
- Impact of the class imbalance 
- Dropping any data?


Analytics (Dianne, Ayshe, Mirian, Crystal)
- age groups (filtering)
- gender and purchase amount
- purchase amount by location
- previous purchases by location
- category by purchase amount (insight into high-purchase categories to prioritize product inventory)
- category by purchase amount by location - inform what promotions to run

Final Conclusions (All)
- (Adi's Comments) Evaluation criteria: Define how you’ll judge “optimal” location—will you use distance buffers, drive-time analysis, or demographic thresholds? Mention your metrics or scoring rubric.
