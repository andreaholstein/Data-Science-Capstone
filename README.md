# DSI Group Project Team 3

## Case Study

- A major clothing brand, popular with athletes and young women, is looking to open a new brick-and-mortar store, and hopes to launch a new store promotion. The brand needs to identify the optimal geographical location to open a new store based on where their target shopper demographic is located, and tailoring their promotion to incentivize new and existing shoppers to visit the new store and drive sales conversions.
- Our stakeholders are: the brand's marketing and sales departments, product managers & data analysts, the finance team and senior leadership (operations).
- The outcome of our analysis will help inform the brand's marketing strategies, and product offerings in certain jurisdictions. It will also inform annual budgeting. This project will offer additional insight into customer shopping behaviours, and inform strategies to retain and acquire customers.
- Our project will demonstrate a keen understanding of how to identify business opportunities and apply data-driven decision-making in the retail & commerce sector.

## Business Motivation

- Analyzing customer demographics, we will identify the optimal location for a new store, and tailor their launch promotion to target new and existing customers based on those criteria.

## The Dataset

- [Shop Customer Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset)

## Challenges on the Horizon

- We feel like we can already assume who the target demographic of our brand is - our challenge is to perform our analysis agnostic of that assumption to see if our hypothesis aligns with our conclusion.
