# DSI Group Project Team 3

## Case Study

- A major clothing brand, popular with athletes and young women, is looking to open a new brick-and-mortar store, and hopes to launch a new store promotion. The brand needs to identify the optimal geographical location to open a new store based on where their target shopper demographic is located, and tailoring their promotion to incentivize new and existing shoppers to visit the new store and drive sales conversions.
- Our project will demonstrate a keen understanding of how to identify business opportunities and apply data-driven decision-making in the retail & commerce sector.

## Business Motivation

- Analyzing customer demographics, we will identify the optimal location for a new store, and tailor their launch promotion to target new and existing customers based on those criteria.

## The Dataset

- [Shop Customer Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset)

## Challenges on the Horizon

- We feel like we can already assume who the target demographic of our brand is - our challenge is to perform our analysis agnostic of that assumption to see if our hypothesis aligns with our conclusion.
