### üìäMethodology:

To evaluate potential store locations and customer behavior patterns, the following multi-step methodology was applied:

1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

- Loaded and cleaned the customer dataset using Pandas.
- Handled missing values, standardized column names, and transformed categorical features where necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express to explore customer distribution by age, gender, location, and purchasing behavior.
- Identified key metrics such as total spending, repeat purchases, and product category trends across different regions.

3. Dealing with Class Imbalance

- Applied resampling techniques to balance customer classes when modeling or analyzing groups

4. Visualization Dashboards

- Bar Charts ‚Äì For comparing category-level totals (e.g., product categories, locations).
- Heatmaps ‚Äì For visualizing customer concentration across locations
- Count Plots ‚Äì To show distribution of customers by gender and other discrete features
- Pie Charts ‚Äì Used to represent proportional data such as the total purchase distribution by product category.
- Area Plots ‚Äì Included to track cumulative or continuous trends over categories.
- Scatter Plots ‚Äì For bubble charts showing relationships between customer count, repeat purchases, and total spend.

5. Geographic Analysis

- Heatmaps and bubble charts use to represent store location potential and customer behavior density.

## üåçReview of Raw Data and Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Understanding the Raw Data**  
  The dataset contains 18 features:  
  *Unnamed:0* (int64), *Customer ID* (int64), *Age* (int64), *Gender* (object), *Item Purchased* (object), *Category* (object), *Purchase Amount (USD)* (int64), *Location* (object), *Color* (object), *Season* (object), *Review Rating* (float64), *Subscription Status* (object), *Shipping Type* (object), *Discount Applied* (object), *Promo Code Used* (object), *Previous Purchases* (int64), *Payment Method* (object), and *Frequency of Purchases* (object).  
  This mix of numerical and categorical data provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences.

- **Understanding the Features**  
  Features capture customer details (e.g., Age, Gender, Location), purchase specifics (e.g., Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount), and engagement metrics (e.g., Subscription Status, Previous Purchases). Categorical features like Color, Season, and Shipping Type allow segmentation, while numerical features like Review Rating and Purchase Amount enable quantitative analysis of trends and correlations.

- **Correlation between Features**  
  Purchase Amount (USD) shows weak correlations with Age and Review Rating, suggesting no strong linear relationship. Subscription Status and Promo Code Used are highly correlated, indicating subscribers frequently use discounts, which could influence spending patterns.


### üåüConclusion of reviewing the raw data and EDA:

- How many states are there?
  There are 50 unique states in the dataset
- How many of each gender?
  The dataset includes 2652 males and 1248 females
- What categories are there?
  There are 4 product categories - Clothing, Accessories, Footwear, Outerwear. Clothing is the category with the most purchases
- What season has the most spending?
  Fall has the highest spending
- How many customers have subscriptions?
  1053 customers have subscriptions
- What items are sold?
  25 unique items are sold, including Blouse, Sweater, Jeans, Handbag, etc.

### üß©Assumptions, Limiting Conditions, Data Risks:

The dataset assumes representative sampling of customer purchases but may contain biases due to uneven gender distribution or sparse location data, potentially skewing demographic insights. To address sampling bias, compare dataset demographics (e.g., age, gender) to U.S. census data; sparse location data should be handled by grouping low-sample regions or imputing missing values cautiously to avoid distorting geographic trends. Data risks include potential inconsistencies in categorical entries (e.g., typos in Color or Item Purchased) and incomplete records, which could affect analysis reliability.

- Our inital dataset was not suitable for our business problem. This resulted in us sourcing another dataset from Kaggle.
- At the beginning, we believed we could assume who the target demographic of our brand is - our challenge was to perform our analysis agnostic of that assumption to see if our hypothesis aligns with our conclusion.
- We had concerns that the data may be biased: we did in fact identify a considerable class imbalance between the sexes of the respondents in our dataset which we balanced, and performed our analyses on this updated dataset.
- Some of our initial data analysis proved redundant as we learned more about the process. For instance, we initially thought we might need to create smaller samples to perform our analysis on, thinking our dataset might be too large and performance-demanding. However, that proved to not be necessary, and so we performed our analyses on the full dataset.

### üßπData Cleaning:

For data cleaning, we first performed validation on the dataset to check for missing data, nulls, or invalid data types. We also ran checks to check for typos in the string data, and renamed the column headers in our dataframe for more legibility.

The dataset exhibits a significant gender imbalance, with 2652 males and 1248 females, as observed in the EDA. The class_imbalance.ipynb script attempts to address this by oversampling the minority class (Female) to match the majority class (Male), creating a balanced dataset with equal gender representation.

### ‚úÖData Cleaning Conclusions:

All-in-all, our dataset was very clean, and no data needed to be dropped or imputed to correct for missing information.

We identified a class imbalance issue in our dataset, where the data was skewed heavily toward male values (2652 males vs. 1248 females). Concerned that this would potentially skewing insights into purchasing behavior, we balanced this by oversampling the female class, as implemented in the updated script, balances the dataset, improving model fairness and ensuring equitable representation in analyses.
